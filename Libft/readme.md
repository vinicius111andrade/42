# Libft
This is a library of common C functions that we recreated for exercise purposes. We actually recreate the behaviour not necessarily the exact function. There are also some extra useful functions.


## Functions:

note that the ft in ft_functionName stands for FuncTion

isalpha, isdigit, isprint, isalnum
