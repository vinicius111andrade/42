# Libft
This is a library of common C functions that we recreated for exercise purposes. We actually recreate the behaviour not necessarily the exact function. There are also some extra useful functions.


## Functions:

note that the ft in ft_functionName stands for FuncTion
#### I) Do stuff to chars
- ft_isalpha, tests if it is in the alphabet
- ft_isdigit, tests if it is a digit
- ft_isalnum, tests if it is alphanumeric
- ft_isprint, tests if it is printable
- ft_isascii, tests if the value given is within the ascii range
- ft_tolower, transforms an uppercase letter into lowercase
- ft_toupper, transforms a lowercase letter into uppercase
#### II) Writes stuff to a specific fd using the write function
